This solar-powered monitoring system utilizes sensors for environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure) and air quality (PM2.5, PM10) to collect real-time data. The data is transmitted via Wi-Fi and MQTT to a central server for analysis, reporting, and informed environmental decision-making.
